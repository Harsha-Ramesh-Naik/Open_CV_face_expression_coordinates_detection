# Open_CV_face_expression_coordinates_detection
This code detects facial landmarks in images using dlib's shape predictor. Face expression recognition leverages facial landmark coordinates, capturing the precise positions for various emotional states on the face. These coordinates exhibit unique patterns or norms for each emotion, enabling the classification of facial expressions.
